# K2 SE Browser Slicer

A local-first slicer for the Creality K2 SE. Upload an STL or 3MF, arrange it on the printer plate, choose PLA settings, slice, inspect the layers, and download G-code without installing a desktop slicer.

Real slicing is performed in the browser by the open-source Kiri:Moto engine. Model data stays in the browser and is not uploaded to a slicing service. The engine, worker, and WebAssembly helper are bundled with this project, so slicing has no runtime dependency on Grid.Space or another remote service.

## K2 SE Profile

- Build volume: `220 x 215 x 245 mm`
- Filament: `1.75 mm`
- Nozzle: `0.4 mm`
- Nozzle maximum: `300 C`
- Bed maximum: `100 C`
- G-code flavor: generic Klipper-style, single filament
- CFS: not used

The generated start and end G-code is deliberately generic. Compare the first output with a known-good Creality K2 SE profile and run a small supervised test print before relying on it for long jobs.

## Run Locally

Requirements: Node.js 22.13 or newer and pnpm. No desktop slicer is required.

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

## Production Build

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.

The production Node server only serves the built web app. Browser slicing does not require the optional native slicing API.

## Deploy Online

The browser engine makes the main app deployable as a static site. Build with `pnpm build`, then publish the `dist` directory to Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or another static host.

Docker is also supported:

```bash
docker build -t k2-se-browser-slicer .
docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 k2-se-browser-slicer
```

The `dist` directory includes the slicing engine under `kiri/` and its WebAssembly helper under `wasm/`. Keep those paths together when deploying. Once the site itself is available, slicing does not require an internet connection.

## Features

- STL upload and browser preview
- 3MF upload and preview when its geometry can be parsed
- Orbit, pan, and zoom
- Move, rotate, scale, center, lay-flat, reset, duplicate, delete, and auto-arrange
- Model dimensions and K2 SE plate/height validation
- PLA layer height, walls, top/bottom layers, infill, supports, brim/skirt, temperatures, speeds, nozzle, filament diameter, and flow
- Real browser-based slicing with no installed slicer
- Parsed layer preview, print-time estimate, and filament estimate
- Local G-code download

## Optional Native Backend

The original PrusaSlicer/SuperSlicer wrapper remains available for development or server-side workflows. Run `pnpm dev:full` and set `PRUSASLICER_BIN` only if you explicitly want that optional API. The browser UI does not require it.
